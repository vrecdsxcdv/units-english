2.2 The Concept of an Ideal Educational Website

Based on the results of the sociological survey and the analysis of existing educational platforms, it became clear that modern students need a structured, practice-oriented and thematic approach to learning English. Traditional platforms often focus on general language skills without a clear connection to specific areas of use, especially in the field of digital technologies and programming.

An ideal educational website for learning English should combine several key characteristics that make the learning process effective, accessible and engaging for students with different levels of preparation.

Key Characteristics of an Ideal Educational Website:

1. Structured Learning by Topics and Levels. The website should provide a clear structure of educational material divided into levels (A1-A2, B1-B2, C1-C2) according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). Each level should contain thematic blocks covering different areas of language use: grammar, vocabulary, practical skills, and specialized topics such as programming, internet services, and international communication.

2. Step-by-Step Progression. Each topic should be divided into logical steps (for example, 10 steps per topic), allowing students to gradually move from simple concepts to more complex ones. This approach ensures consistent learning and helps avoid information overload. Students can clearly see their progress and understand which step they are currently on.

3. Interactive Exercises and Practice. The website should include various types of interactive exercises: fill-in-the-blank tasks, multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop activities, and checkable tasks with instant feedback. Interactive elements increase student engagement and make the learning process more dynamic and interesting.

4. Real-Life Context and Practical Application. Learning materials should be connected to real-life situations and practical use of English, especially in the digital environment. Examples should include technical vocabulary, common phrases used in programming, working with online platforms, reading documentation, and international communication. This helps students understand how English is used in real contexts.

5. Visual Design and User Experience. A modern educational website should have an attractive, intuitive and responsive design. The use of modern design techniques such as glassmorphism, smooth animations, and adaptive layouts improves the user experience and makes learning more comfortable. The interface should be mobile-friendly and accessible on different devices.

6. Progress Tracking and Personalization. The system should track the user's progress, showing which lessons have been completed and which topics require more attention. Visual indicators such as progress bars, step squares, and achievement badges motivate students to continue learning. Personalization allows the website to adapt to the individual needs and pace of each student.

7. Multilevel Assessment System. An ideal website should include a placement test that determines the student's current level of English. This helps users start learning from the appropriate level and avoid repeating material they already know. Regular tests and assessments allow students to check their knowledge and identify areas for improvement.

8. Accessibility and Free Access. The educational platform should be accessible to all students, regardless of their financial situation. Free access to quality educational materials helps overcome barriers to education and provides equal opportunities for learning English.

Description of the Developed Educational Website

To implement the concept of an ideal educational website, a web platform for learning English was developed using modern technologies: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The platform provides structured learning from level A1 to C2 with interactive lessons, testing, and progress tracking.

Main Features of the Developed Platform:

1. Registration and Authentication System. The website includes a secure registration and login system. Users can create personal accounts, which allows the platform to save their progress and provide personalized learning experience.

2. Placement Test. The website offers a comprehensive placement test consisting of 100 questions covering grammar, vocabulary, and word forms. Based on the results, the system automatically determines the user's level (A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2) and recommends an appropriate starting point for learning.

3. Structured Content by Levels. The platform contains educational materials organized into six levels (A1-A2, B1, B2, C1-C2). Each level includes multiple thematic blocks covering essential grammar topics, vocabulary, and practical language skills. For example, the A1-A2 level includes 71 topics, ranging from basic grammar (nouns, verbs, tenses) to practical themes (family, hobbies, travel, technology).

4. 10-Step Learning System. Each topic consists of 10 steps, providing gradual progression from introduction to practice. Each step includes theoretical explanations, examples, vocabulary, and interactive exercises. This structure ensures consistent learning and clear visualization of progress.

5. Interactive Lessons. Lessons include various types of interactive elements: checkable exercises, fill-in-the-blank tasks, multiple-choice questions, and practical examples. Students receive instant feedback, which helps them correct mistakes and reinforce their knowledge.

6. Advanced Topics for Upper Levels. The platform includes advanced topics for B2-C2 levels, such as:
   • Collocations — word combinations and natural phrases
   • Idiomatic Expressions — idioms and figurative language
   • Work & Business English — professional communication and business correspondence
   • Medical and Legal English — specialized vocabulary
   • Rhetorical Devices — advanced stylistic techniques (anaphora, chiasmus, antithesis, zeugma)
   These topics help students master English at a professional and academic level.

7. Modern Glassmorphism Design. The interface uses modern glassmorphism design with smooth animations, beautiful gradients, and transparent glass effects. The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, providing a comfortable learning experience on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

8. Progress Tracking. The platform tracks user progress through visual indicators: progress bars, step squares (1-10), and completion markers. Users can see which topics they have completed and which steps remain, motivating them to continue learning.

9. Thematic Sidebar Navigation. Each level includes a sidebar with a list of available topics. The active topic is highlighted, and users can easily switch between different topics. This provides clear navigation and helps users organize their learning process.

10. Step-by-Step Navigation. Each lesson page includes "Back" and "Next" buttons, allowing users to move sequentially through the steps. The navigation system ensures that users do not miss important information and complete each step before moving forward.

Technology Stack

The platform is built using modern web technologies that ensure high performance, scalability, and user experience:
• Frontend: Next.js 15 (React 19 framework), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion for animations
• Backend: Next.js API Routes for server-side logic
• Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for data management
• Design: Custom UI components with glassmorphism effects, responsive layout, and adaptive design

Conclusion

The developed educational website implements the key principles of an ideal learning platform: structured content, thematic organization, step-by-step progression, interactive exercises, and modern design. The platform addresses the problems identified in the sociological survey, such as language barriers in working with digital technologies and the lack of practical, thematically-oriented English learning resources.

By combining theoretical knowledge with practical application, especially in the context of programming and digital technologies, the platform helps students develop real-world English skills that they can immediately apply in their studies, work, and everyday use of online services and international platforms.
